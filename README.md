In this final project of Introduction to Containers w/ Docker, Kubernetes & OpenShift , you will build and deploy a simple guestbook application. The application consists of a web front end which will have a text input where you can enter any text and submit. For all of these we will create Kubernetes Deployments and Pods. Then we will apply Horizontal Pod Scaling to the Guestbook application and finally work on Rolling Updates and Rollbacks.In this final project of Introduction to Containers w/ Docker, Kubernetes & OpenShift , you will build and deploy a simple guestbook application.
